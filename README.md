## Updates
- 10/15/23: âœ¨ DehazeNeRF was accepted into 3DV!


## Setup
You can use the following to set up a Conda environment.\

```

```
Download our pretrained model [HERE](). Put the pretrained model in a `runs` folder.

We put the datasets into a folder outside of the repo to create the following file structure
```python

```

### Synthetic Dataset in DehazeNeRF downloaded from [here]()
File structure should be as follows:
```python

```

### Real Capture Dataset in DehazeNeRF downloaded from [here]()
File structure should be as follows:
```python

```


## Usage
```

```



To test:
```
